If you're anything like me, you enjoy automating repetitive tasks. One of those tasks I encountered recently was converting my ABN AMRO Excel exports into a format that the financial software I use, could actually read: OFX. Initially, it seemed like a quick fixâ€”just some minor tweaks and it would be done. But, as is often the case, the rabbit hole went much deeper than expected.

Here's the full story of how I turned those unruly `.xls` files into something MoneyWell would happily digest, using a bit of Node.js magic.

## Why I Needed This Solution
Like many Dutchies, I download my transaction data from ABN AMRO to keep track of expenses and manage finances. But I quickly discovered that the Excel format provided by ABN AMRO isnâ€™t exactly friendly for other software. Financial tools like MoneyWell and GnuCash need a standardized format like OFX to import transactions. And thereâ€™s no built-in way to convert it directly.

Instead of manually copying and pasting values each month, I thought: why not automate this? A bit of scripting, a few lines of code, and Iâ€™d be done in 15 minutes, right?

Wrong.

## The Challenge
ABN AMRO gives you an `.xls` file, which in theory is a pretty standard format. But when you dive into it, the real challenge becomes apparent:

- **Inconsistent Descriptions**: Every type of transaction has its own way of storing data, including varying prefixes, random extra text, and different payee placements.
- **No Direct Way to Convert**: OFX isnâ€™t just a basic formatâ€”itâ€™s a structured file format used by many financial institutions, with strict specifications.

So, we needed a robust solution that could:
1. Parse the Excel file.
2. Extract meaningful transaction details.
3. Reformat and save it all into a well-formed `.ofx` file.

Letâ€™s dive into how I tackled each of these problems.

## Building the Conversion Script in Node.js
I started by setting up a simple Node.js script, which would:
1. Read the `.xls` file using a library like `xlsx`.
2. Convert the transactions into a JSON format.
3. Extract critical information like date, amount, and payee.
4. Generate an OFX file using `xmlbuilder`.

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of the process:

### Step 1: Reading the Excel File
For this, I used the `xlsx` package. Itâ€™s straightforward and can handle most of the oddities of `.xls` files. Hereâ€™s how I set it up:

```javascript
const xlsx = require('xlsx');
const workbook = xlsx.readFile('abnamro-transactions.xls');
const sheetName = workbook.SheetNames[0];
const sheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName];
const transactions = xlsx.utils.sheet_to_json(sheet);
```

Simple enough, right? The output is a clean JSON array that we can easily loop through. But now we get to the tricky part: parsing the weird descriptions.

### Step 2: Extracting the Payee
The `Omschrijving` (description) field in ABN AMROâ€™s Excel exports can be a nightmare. A transaction from Albert Heijn might look something like:

```
BEA, Apple Pay                   Albert Heijn,PAS123             NR:ABCDEF, 01.01.24/10:00        AMSTELVEEN
```

Or worse, a manual bank transfer will have a completely different structure:

```
SEPA Overboeking                 IBAN: NL00ABNA0123456789        BIC: ABNANL2A                    Naam: FOOBAR                    Omschrijving: Baz
```

To handle this, I wrote a function that matches and extracts payees and transaction details based on known patterns:

```javascript
function extractPayee(description) {
  const dynamicFormats = ["BEA,", "GEA,", "APP", "eCom"];
  for (const format of dynamicFormats) {
    if (description.startsWith(format)) {
      const start = 24;
      const end = description.indexOf(",", start) !== -1 ? description.indexOf(",", start) : start + 30;
      return description.substring(start, end).trim();
    }
  }

  if (description.startsWith("SEPA Overboeking")) {
    const match = description.match(/Naam:\s*([^\s].*?)\s*(?=IBAN|BIC|Omschrijving|$)/);
    return match ? match[1].trim() : "Unknown Payee";
  }
  return "Unknown Format";
}
```

This little function saved me a ton of manual tweaking later on.

### Step 3: Converting to OFX
The OFX format requires a very specific structure, so I used `xmlbuilder` to construct the XML content. Hereâ€™s a snippet of how I generated a single transaction:

```javascript
const builder = require('xmlbuilder');
const ofx = builder.create('OFX')
  .ele('SIGNONMSGSRSV1')
    .ele('SONRS')
      .ele('STATUS')
        .ele('CODE', 0).up()
        .ele('SEVERITY', 'INFO').up()
      .up()
      .ele('DTSERVER', new Date().toISOString()).up()
      .ele('LANGUAGE', 'ENG').up()
    .up()
  .up()
  .ele('BANKMSGSRSV1')
    .ele('STMTTRNRS')
      .ele('TRNUID', '1001').up()
      .ele('STATUS')
        .ele('CODE', 0).up()
        .ele('SEVERITY', 'INFO').up()
      .up()
      .ele('STMTRS')
        .ele('CURDEF', 'EUR').up()
        .ele('BANKTRANLIST')
          .ele('STMTTRN')
            .ele('TRNTYPE', 'DEBIT').up()
            .ele('DTPOSTED', '20241008000000').up()
            .ele('TRNAMT', -3.25).up()
            .ele('FITID', 'T123').up()
            .ele('NAME', 'Albert Heijn').up()
            .ele('MEMO', 'Groceries').up()
          .up()
        .up()
      .up()
    .up()
  .up();
```

You get the ideaâ€”each transaction needs to be meticulously formatted.

## Results and Final Thoughts
After some trial and error (okay, a lot of it), the script now converts ABN AMROâ€™s chaotic Excel exports into beautifully structured OFX files, ready to be imported into MoneyWell. Itâ€™s not perfectâ€”new formats still pop up occasionallyâ€”but itâ€™s been a huge timesaver for me.
